# Ardu_ECU

##  Arduino based ECU / FADEC for model Jet engines.
The core idea is to use all power components which are available off the shelf
e.g. 
Brushed or brushless Speed controller for starter motor and fuel pump control,
MOSFET module for gas valve solenoid control and
Glow plug driver module for providing power to glow plug.

Current code is based on ESP32 DevKit which is easily available from the market and is a fairly powerful microcontroller. 
By combining these components and providing a suitable code a fully functional model jet engine ECU can be built
